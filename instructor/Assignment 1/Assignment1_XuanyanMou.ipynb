Also, “team” may appear close to these words because many sports articles are published and discussed online. A surprising placement is “market,” since it could be related to “stocks” in financial news or “game” in the context of the video game market. However, “market” appears closer to “health,” which suggests the healthcare markets. One plausible explanation is that this corpus emphasizes health and political topics, which make “market” to be more associated with health instead of finance or gaming."

Large text corpora can reflect bias in societal stuctures that have structural bias toward specific groups to be assocaited with specific traits, roles, or other contexts. Since word embeddings are trained to learn from word co-occurrence and contextual similarity, so traning will caputre these statistical patterns without considering the information are accurate or not. Hence, if some associations appear more often in the dataset, they become encoded as closer vectors in the embedding space. Thus, existing social biases in the data are directly learned by the model which leads to biases.</font>"

This approach first identifies a bias direction in the embedding space, such as a gender direction defined by word pairs like women and man. The embeddings are adjusted by removing the component of each word vector along the bias direction, and rest of other vector remain unchanged. Then, basied associations are weakened without retraining the model or changing unrelated semantic relationships. Thus, this method is effective because it directly targes the learned bias while keeping most of orginal strucre of the embedding space, so this will not need to retrain the model again. </font>"
